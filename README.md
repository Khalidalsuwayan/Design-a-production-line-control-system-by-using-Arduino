# Design-a-production-line-control-system-by-using-Arduino
The system is to separate three types of products in the production line. If we have three boxes and each one has a different size we can you this technique to separate them by using 2 Photodiode and 2 servo motors each one attached to an arm. How it works exactly? If We have 10x10, 20x20, 30x30 cm boxes. When the box 30x30 cm pass it will cover all Photodiodes. Hence, there is no light and servo motors are OFF and it will be dropped into the end container. Where if the box 20x20 cm pass only the upper Photodiode is ON so the servo motor that moves from 0-degree to 60-degree will move and drops the box into the right container. The last box which is 10x10 cm when it passes all the Photodiodes will be ON. Hence, the second servo motor will be ON and turn from 180-degree to 120-degree and drops the box into the left container. See the hand sketch uploaded for more illustration.
